Prismatic for iOS just got a whole lot better. In our latest update, we’ve made several improvements that make the experience easier and better-looking for both current and new users: 

We’ve updated the design to look great on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The changes make the most of the iPhone's increased screen size and enable higher resolution images, so you can get the most out of Prismatic on your new phone.

We’ve also heard your feedback on the need for simple sharing to outside social networks. With this update, it's simpler than ever! Share your favorite stories with your friends through Facebook, Twitter, email or any other app on your phone with two easy clicks.
