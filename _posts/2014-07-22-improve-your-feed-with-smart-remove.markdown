Today we released Smart Remove, a feature that gives you more control over what you see in your feed. Now, when you dislike a story, you can tell us why, and we'll tailor your feed accordingly. You also now have the ability to block a publisher, topic or a user. Or you can indicate, for example, that you want to see stories about Magic, but not Magic: the Gathering (or vice-versa).

###why should I care?

Though we try really hard to pick out the best stories for you, chances are at some point you’ve seen a story that was either uninteresting, or even offensive, and it ruined your reading experience. Now, when you click the dislike button on Prismatic, we can get more specific feedback from you about what it was you didn't like. In turn, your feedback will help make your feed more awesome, as well as improve the quality of stories on Prismatic for everyone.

###how does it work?

When you dislike a story, it will be removed from your feed, so you won’t have to look at it anymore. Then you have the option to fine-tune your feed by removing or blocking topics you don’t want to follow.

You also have the option to report content as being explicit, or let us know if the story was tagged in the wrong topic. If there’s some other reason you want it removed, check “other” and let us know.

Check out what’s new in your feed, and if you see something you don’t like, tell us why!

We are always working to improve your experience, and this is our first step in giving you more options for disliking stories.

So, what do you think? We’re always here and we love to chat: feedback@getprismatic.com
