Recommendation systems are an increasingly important component of the world’s largest and most successful digital products. On July 8th, we invited some of the experts working on recommendations at big companies like Facebook, Netflix, and LinkedIn to share their expertise and insights into how recommendations work in production. We’ve filmed these talks and are sharing the videos with everyone today.

The first talk was from Lars Backstrom, Facebook’s Engineering Director for News Feed. He talked about some of the machine learning systems that power each user’s newsfeed that intelligently select which stories to show. We got a glimpse into some of the social network features, like measuring dispersion, that are the most valuable for predicting user engagement.

The second talk was from Guy Lebanon, LinkedIn’s Head of Feed Infrastructure and Relevance. He presented a holistic view of the many different places where recommendations are used at LinkedIn and the personalization models that power the recommendations. He then dived deep into the details of the ranking algorithm and supporting infrastructure.


The last talk of the evening was from Harald Steck, Senior Data Scientist at Netflix. He presented details of the matrix factorization models that power the video recommendations for ranking suggested video titles to users. The talk was a deep dive into the algorithmic details of training a matrix factorization model that optimizes a ranking metric.

The technical talks provided fantastic insights into the state-of-the-art recommendation technology running in production at the companies leading the industry in user recommendations. The talks sparked many interesting discussions, and everyone left inspired to apply the lessons learned in their own work. The night was a huge success, and we’re looking forward to more events like this in the future.
