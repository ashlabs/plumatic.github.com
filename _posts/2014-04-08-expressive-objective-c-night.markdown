We just had our first event specifically for iOS developers. We were lucky to have three great speakers for our inaugural event: Tim Burks of Renaissance.io and Silicon Valley iOS Developers' Meetup, Dave Lee of Facebook, and our own Ian Wong, of Canada.

People's comments were so positive about the event, we were blown away. Thanks so much to everyone for coming by, special thanks to our speakers, and we'll definitely be investing in having more awesome events throughout the year.

In case you missed it, we've got videos of each talk, as well as (for the first time) a podcast of the audio! Check em out here:
