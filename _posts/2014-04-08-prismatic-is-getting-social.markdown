Right now you can follow topics and publishers on Prismatic, but we’ve always planned to make people just as important.

If you’ve been a longtime web user, you may have noticed that the old share counts in story headers have been replaced with counts of Prismatic social actions.

Today, we’re launching a newly redesigned profile with cover photo, avatar, bio, and the ability to publish your recommend, save, read, and interest actions to both Prismatic and external networks.

Lots more is coming, so get ready.
