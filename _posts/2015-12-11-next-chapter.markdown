Four years ago, we set out to build a personalized news reader that would change the way people consume content. For many of you, we did just that. But we also learned content distribution is a tough business and we’ve failed to grow at a rate that justifies continuing to support our Prismatic News products.

Beginning December 20th, 2015, our iOS, Android and web news reader products will no longer be available and access to our Interest Graph APIs will be discontinued.

Once the product is shut down, you will no longer have access to the stories you’ve read or saved within Prismatic. We recommend saving anything you want to remember by adding the story to Pocket, emailing it to yourself or copying and pasting the links into another document.

Thanks to all of you who supported us during this journey; we hope you’ve learned lots of interesting things along the way.

The Prismatic Team
