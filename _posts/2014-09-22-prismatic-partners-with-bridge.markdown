###Apply to Bridge, work on Prismatic

Today we’re excited to announce our participation in Designer Fund’s [Bridge](http://designerfund.com/bridge/) program. Bridge connects experienced designers with design-forward startups and a community of great designers. We’re delighted to be included in the program along with other awesome companies like Square, Dropbox and Pinterest. The application period begins today, and runs through October 26.

You can find out more info about Bridge [here](http://designerfund.com/bridge/).

###Bring your experience

At Prismatic, we seek to understand many kinds of users, and this drive informs and inspires our design decisions. One of our greatest assets has been the diversity of our design team. Among us we have designers with backgrounds in visual design, information architecture, visual and social design. Through Bridge, we have the opportunity to further diversify our team. We’re so excited to see what new perspectives you’ll bring to the table!

Learn what you could work on [here](http://designerfund.com/bridge/company/prismatic/).

###Bring your passion

As a Bridge Designer, you’ll be an integral part of the entire product cycle, from research to ideation, creation and testing. You’ll get to define and work on brand-new projects. With your expertise, you’ll be helping us answer questions like these: How do we design an online profile that’s more empathetic? What’s the best way to introduce people to new interests? How can we use our platform to help people learn and grow?

###Bring your voice

We care deeply about both contributing to the larger design community and learning from it. Whether it’s sharing about our (ever evolving) [design process](http://blog.getprismatic.com/making-good-design-decisions/) in a blog post, or hosting [panels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDoOAz5rMFM) with some of today’s top designers, or sharing the ups-and-downs of [creating new products](http://www.teehanlax.com/story/prismatic/) with our partners, we’re always looking to share with and learn from others. We’d love to have you be a part of this ongoing dialogue as we seek to improve both Prismatic and each other. Through this process of give-and-take, we all become better designers.
