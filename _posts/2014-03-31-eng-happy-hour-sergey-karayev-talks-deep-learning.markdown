Last week we were very lucky to have [Sergey Karayev](http://sergeykarayev.com/) come by the office to talk about deep learning and computer vision.

Sergey is a PhD candidate in CS at UC Berkeley, and works on artificial intelligence, focusing on computer vision.

His talk was really cool, and opened up a lot of questions from the team about what deep learning really means, and whether guess and check is a valid scientific method. We got a lot of requests from those who couldnâ€™t make it to post slides, so [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44891/research/computer_vision_and_deep_learning_feb_2014_at_prismatic.pdf) they are.

From his abstract:

Computer vision is going through a major upgrade of recognition capabilities. A year and a half ago, the state of the art for image classification and object detection was based on hand-designed processing pipelines: computing features, pooling over spatial areas, and coding to a high dimensional space.

"Deep learning" methods jointly optimize all parameters of these steps, performed in a hierarchy of several layers. When applied to very large datasets and trained for a long time on efficient GPUs, deep learning significantly outperforms the old state of the art. This was first established on the ImageNet classification benchmark, and recently became true for object detection benchmarks as well.

I will review these methods, existing academic benchmarks, and known industry deployments, discuss necessary conditions for successful application, and share ongoing work on applying them to yet more visual recognition use cases. I will also show popular deep learning open-source software that our group maintains: [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe).
