We just released our first native Android Prismatic app! Download it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Prismatic.android).

This was the first time many of us had worked on an Android app, and we learned a ton in the process.   [Nicholas Stevens](http://getprismatic.com/profile/nick), our Product Manager, wrote  an [internal guide](https://github.com/nstevens/androidguide#introduction) to keep a record the thinking behind some of the decisions made, and educate everyone working on the app on platform-specific specs and tips.

By the end, [this guide](https://github.com/nstevens/androidguide#introduction) detailed a substantial amount of hard-won lessons, so we thought it might be helpful to make it public for others just starting down the Android path.  This guide is intended for anyone from a new android engineer who just wants to write code as fast as possible, to designers who are interested in committing style changes or assets to the codebase.

[Check it out](https://github.com/nstevens/androidguide#introduction) and please let us know if you have any feedback or additions!
