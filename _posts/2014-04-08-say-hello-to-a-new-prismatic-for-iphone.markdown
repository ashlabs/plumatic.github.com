Today, we’re happy to show you a new version of Prismatic for iPhone that we've been working on for the last few months.

 In the new version, the app design has taken a huge step forward, and it’s now even more of a joy to find great stories that you wouldn’t have found otherwise.

When you find a story, you also now have the ability to save the story for later or to remove a story you don't like. Your reading experience is also better than ever with cleaner, more readable typography.

You can [check it out in the App Store now!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/prismatic-always-interesting/id551206444?mt=8)
