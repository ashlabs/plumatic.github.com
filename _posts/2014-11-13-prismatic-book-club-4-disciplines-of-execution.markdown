Recently, we decided to get serious about about our never-ending quest for knowledge, and [collected the hundreds of books](http://blog.getprismatic.com/how-we-made-a-library-and-you-can-too/) around the office into a real, live [library](http://blog.getprismatic.com/how-we-made-a-library-and-you-can-too/). Since then, we’ve been slowly but surely growing our library, with team members adding titles across all disciplines, from design books, to drawing, computer science, meditation, business and writing.

As we were getting organized, people also started to get really excited about the idea of company-wide book club. And at our last weekly meeting, the Prismatic Book Club was officially kicked off. Our CEO, Bradford Cross, bounded in, even more amped up than his usual monday morning demeanor, arms full of copies of the new business book he’d been reading, excited to share his new learnings with the team.

The [book](http://www.amazon.com/Disciplines-Execution-Achieving-Wildly-Important/dp/145162705X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1415907662&sr=1-1&keywords=4+disciplines+of+execution) he wanted us all to read was “The 4 Disciplines of Execution” by Chris McChesney, Sean Covey, and Jim Huling.

“It basically states that the reason initiatives fail is that organizations try to do too much.” explained Bradford, “Executives need to place what is important in front of the organization in the form of a goal… [Where organizations have trouble is] not as much in defining the strategy as executing the strategy.”

The basic premise boils down to this: if you want to achieve anything, you have to focus on no more than 1 - 2 “wildly” important goals. Attempt more than two goals at once and you're destined to fall short on all of them. So it’s important to distill your efforts down to the most important thing you can be working on to improve your business. In addition, don’t focus on only tracking outcomes, but on everything you can control. And keep your progress on public scoreboards so everyone can see how the team is doing.

So far the book has already been getting the team’s wheels turning. “I like the idea of [lag and lead](http://kpilibrary.com/topics/lagging-and-leading-indicators) indicators.” says Manish, one of our backend engineers. “The interesting question is: how do you identify lead indicators? How do you choose ones which are important?”

Another member of the Engineering team, Logan, added, “I really liked the points about setting up sub-WIGs [Wildly Important Goals]. Not to ask your team what needs to be done to accomplish the goal because you end up with a huge list of todo's, but ask what are the least number of battles to fight to accomplish it, aka to win the war.”

We’ll be having some group sessions to discuss the book over the next month, and I’ll be sharing our takeaways here. If you’d like to follow along, get a copy of the book [here]([http://](http://www.amazon.com/Disciplines-Execution-Achieving-Wildly-Important/dp/145162705X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1415907662&sr=1-1&keywords=4+disciplines+of+execution)) and start reading! We’ll also be experimenting with an interactive book club so you can join our 1st book club meeting. 

Our first meeting is **12 noon PST on Monday November 17**. I’ll share some of our thoughts, questions and takeaways on Twitter, using the hashtag #prismaticbookclub.
