*or, How We Lost Grandma to Dysentary but Gained Stateless UI*

We had a blast at Prismatic HQ last week, with a lineup of talks exploring the leading edge of functional programming on the frontend:

Prismatic's own [Logan Linn](http://www.twitter.com/loganlinn) kicked off the evening explaining how we increase predictability and reduce complexity at Prismatic using single-direction data flows with ClojureScript.

[Jordan Garcia](http://www.twitter.com/jordanjgarcia) of [Optimizely](http://www.optimizely.com) followed, with a talk on using immutability, one-way data flow and pure functions in the frontend with javascript. He also showed us how they're using Flux at Optimizely as a decoupled way to model application and UI state.

[Richard Feldman](http://www.twitter.com/rtfeldman) of [NoRedInk](http://www.noredink.com) introduced us to [Elm](http://www.elm-lang.org), a functional frontend language for making stateless UIs in the browser. He first tried Elm when building his own personal project, Dreamwriter, and fell down a glorious rabbit hole of immutable data and stateless functions from which he has yet to emerge.

For those who joined us, thanks so much for making the event such a blast. Thanks also to Marco, our esteemed MC for the evening, who dazzled the audience with his array of nerdy programming jokes.

For those who couldn’t make it (or just really want to hear Marco’s jokes again), click through to watch the videos of the entire event:

Oh yeah: we also had these sweet 8-bit tshirts designed by Carolyn Li-Madeo, and modeled by Lucy:

which were unimprovable, except perhaps with one clever addition (next time, Bill!)
