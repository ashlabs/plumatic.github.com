*Part 1 of 2. Stay tuned for Part 2 as our library grows, finds a home, and we implement experimental punishments for late book-returners.*

If you're anything like us, you probably have shelves full of books on innumerable topics. And if you're a lot like us, these books are distributed all over desks, tables, on shelves and in conference rooms, wherever they were last picked up or laid down.

We always felt it gave the office a charming "lived in, intellectual" vibe.

But at a certain point (for example, when you really need to find, "Designing Interfaces for Cat Owners", but it's hidden under a stack of books in a closet), this otherwise flawless system breaks down. Organizing our company book collection had always been on our to-do list, but it took our own Renegade Librarian [Carolyn](http://www.twitter.com/carolynlimadeo) taking the reigns to finally get it done.

Says Carolyn:
> "The culture of learning was a huge part of what made me so excited about Prismatic as a product and also as a company! When I started here, it was great to see books all around, on peoples' desks, in conference rooms! Everyone was talking about things that they had read recently, and yet we had a closet full of books in boxes. It seemed kind of strange that we're so good at sharing and learning, but we basically had a pile of things that was undiscoverable."

So Carolyn set out, with help from Lucy and Gina, to help make the undiscoverable discoverable.

They started by collecting all the books from every corner of the office. Using smartphones, they scanned each book into [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/), and then exported the data into [LibraryThing](http://www.librarything.com).

>"I love LibraryThing, as they are an awesome open-source cataloging software that makes it really easy for people to catalog and organize their own books. I've always wanted to use them, so this seemed like the perfect fit."

Once uploaded, they assigned tags to all 307 books and sorted them into nine different higher-level categories. These tags and categories will help everyone on the team to browse, search and discover books. 

>"Tags are used to assign more granular categories and subject areas to the books, whereas the categories will be used to shelve the books. Since our library is lil’ we’ve decided to forgo traditional classification systems and instead color code books by subject and then order them alphabetically by author’s last name."


Still on the agenda is setting up our shelves, arranging all the books, and getting them circulating. 

We also still need to figure out exactly how borrowing will work, but we're planning to use LibraryThing's collection folders to sort books that are currently being borrowed. 

To continue to foster the growth of the library and to nurture company-wide learning and exploration, we’ll be hosting regular book clubs based on our collection areas. We’re also hoping to create a process of employee book recommendations, where each Prismatic employee brings in a copy of their favorite book to share with the company.

Itching to set up your own library? Our house librarian encourages it:

>"Yeah! People can totally make their own personal libraries and they definitely should! It's a great way to share what you have in your collection with friends and family as well as this awesome quantified self moment, where you can look at your full collection and see what you are interested in."
