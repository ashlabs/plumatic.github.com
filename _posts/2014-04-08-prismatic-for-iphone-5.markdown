Weâ€™re delighted to announce Prismatic for iPhone 5 - and its featured in the App Store!

* We're especially glad that we've finally zeroed in on the interactions users really want (share, recommend, and save) and making saved stories always sync to the phone for offline reading regardless if you save from phone or web. 
* Prismatic newsfeed view is especially awesome on iPhone 5 because we kept the content-focused layouts so the amount of content on screen is just stunning. :) 
* Besides now being optimized with great new visuals for iPhone 5, we have a smoother and more solid product now - native auth for twitter and facebook, not webviews, and fixed a bunch of v1 imperfections.
